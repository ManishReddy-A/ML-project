# H-1B Visa Approval Using Classification

The H-1B is an employment-based, non-immigrant visa category for temporary foreign workers in the United States. Every year, the US immigration department receives over 200,000 petitions and selects 85,000 applications through a random process. The application data is available for public access to perform in-depth longitudinal research and analysis. This data provides key insights into the prevailing wages for job titles being sponsored by US employers under H1-B visa category. In particular, I utilize the 2011-2016 H-1B petition disclosure data to analyze the employers with the most applications, data science related job positions and relationship between salaries offered and cost of living index.
